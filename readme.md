## Building this project for production

-   **Install Dependencies** - You need to run `npm install` to use the required librarys

```sh
$ npm install
```

-   **Run the build:css script** - In the `package.json` you'll se some scripts that compile the code, adding and compressing the sass files to better performance and optimization.
    ```sh
    $ npm run build:css:
    ```
-   **Get the compiled result** - When the build is complete, it will generate a `style.css` in de `css/` folder, that you could use in your applications.

## Important Note

This landing page was originally build by Jonas Schmedtmann, great Udemy instructor who made this site for his online course.
Despite changes I have made in the code, the creation is credited to Jonas Schmedtmann.
